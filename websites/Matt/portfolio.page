[Current game project]

This is the game I'm currently working on, a 2D, open world space rpg. I'm using stb_image, stb_truetype and ImGui for debug UI, but apart from that everything is from scratch in C++.

[Software renderer]

I'm working on a software renderer as a side project to learn more about what happens on the GPU and for fun. The plan is for it to be 3D with lighting and shadows. Everything is from scratch in C++, (https://github.com/m4tthartley/SoftwareRenderer Source code can be found here)

[Graphics demo]

This is a project for me to play around with GPU graphics and try out techniques before putting them in my game. Currently it has basic lighting, model loading/rendering and I just started doing shadows. Made from scratch in C++.

[Kittens]

This is tiny game where you click on the ground to place bowls of food and the cats eat and breed and soon you have a screen full of cats. Why? I have no idea.
